Description:
=============
wrush is command line script that allows a user to performace a variety of operations on the wordpress like creation of modifications of posts and pages, plugin and theme management among other things. It can be used to speed up the deployment of wordpress installations, to disable defectives plugin/themes when you don't have access the admin panel, etc. 

This script is loosely based on the drush script for drupal and it was created to be its equivalent for wordpress. 

This script uses the files from a wordpress installation on the current folder. It was tested mainly with a 3.1 installation, but it can works with other versions as long as function names, parameters and other code requirements remain the same.

Requirements
=============
- php-cli with zip and curl extensions activated

Instalation:
=============
1. if your php executable is no /usr/bin/php modify the first line of the script to match you location. OPTIONAL: modify the variables in the beginning of the file that you feel might necessary (like web_user or web_group)
2. copy the script to /usr/bin
3. make executable with the command: chmod +x /usr/bin/wrush

Notes:
=============	
* Parameters with a asterisk (*) are mandatory.	
* Wrush will display the available options when the required section/action/parameters are not specified.
* With the exception of the action dl (core section), all commands must be run on the root of the wordpress installation folder.
* Some write operations like theme/plugin installation and removal, requires write permissions on some folders (the script will show which ones), but because of limitations of the wordpress code the user running the script must not be root (or a user running sudo).
* The 'perm' action (utils section) sets folder/file permissions for the wordpress installation, but because of php requirements the user running the script must be root (or a user running sudo).
